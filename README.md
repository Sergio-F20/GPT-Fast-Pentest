## Things to Consider

### Api Key
A comment has been left on the script indicating where to insert the API key, to make it easier for users to get started with the script by providing a straightforward approach. However, storing sensitive information like API keys in source code poses a security risk. Its recommended using more secure methods like environment variables or config files.
```export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here```
```
import os
api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```

### Models and Rate Limits
It's important to be aware of rate limits imposed by the API: [Rate Limits - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/rate-limits) <br/><br/>
Depending on your plan, you may prefer using other model: [Models - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/models)
